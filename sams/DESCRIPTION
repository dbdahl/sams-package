Description: Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for posterior simulations of conjugate Bayesian nonparametric
    mixture models. Functionality is provided for Gibbs sampling as in Algorithm 3 of Neal (2000)
    <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2000.10474879>, restricted Gibbs merge-split sampling as described in Jain & Neal
    (2004) <DOI:10.1198/1061860043001>, and sequentially-allocated merge-split sampling, as well as
    summary and utility functions.
