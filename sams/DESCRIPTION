Description: Gibbs-style and Metropolis-Hastings style sampling for posterior simulations in conjugate
    Bayesian nonparametric mixture models. Functionality is provided for Gibbs sampling as in 
    Algorithm 3 of Neal (2000) <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2000.10474879>, restricted Gibbs merge-split 
    sampling as described in Jain & Neal (2004)<DOI:10.1198/1061860043001>, sequentially-allocated 
    merge-split sampling, as well as additional summary and utility functions.
